Due to non-zero demand, I have added an English page for foreigners staying in Georgia.  
All references to "Georgia" on this page refers to the country of Georgia.  
The English version of this article usually lags behind the Georgian version as I don't have lots of time to translate.

# What is ADHD?

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder
characterised by excessive amounts of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that are pervasive,
impairing in multiple contexts, and otherwise age-inappropriate.

ADHD has many different causes: several different genes, diet, environment, etc. 
Although no one knows the exact reason ADHD exists, there are many theories, some of which are listed at the end of this article.

Regardless of the exact reason, today, all of us are subjected to school form a young age, required to attend for hours every week day,
being required to pay attention at all times, doing homework, memorizing text (carefully reading)
and as an adult, 8-14 hours of work (that has to be done with attention),
and concurrently quick learning of new material for purpose of career advancement.
For reasons mentioned above, ADHD is considered a disorder and is a real problem.

ADHD is characterised by many symptoms, but, because ADHD has been most studied in children,
the name only focuses on attention deficit and hyperactivity, as these are the most easily noticeable symptoms in children. 
This is why, the name of this disease can be misleading and a person with ADHD can have attention deficit without hyperactivity.
The symptoms still last into adulthood and some are manifested differently from children.

The most noticeable and problematic symptom that is noticeable in all age group is **lack of attention control**.
In practice, this means, academic success is very difficult, one very specific example,
"[reading comprehension](https://naec.ge/uploads/postData/20-20/magistrebi/testebis%20nimushebi/%E1%83%AC%E1%83%90%E1%83%99%E1%83%98%E1%83%97%E1%83%AE%E1%83%A3%E1%83%9A%E1%83%98%E1%83%A1%20%E1%83%92%E1%83%90%E1%83%90%E1%83%96%E1%83%A0%E1%83%94%E1%83%91%E1%83%90.pdf)"
(one of the national exams),
is either difficult to do or impossible in the short time given, as this requires reading boring text while paying attention.

Approximately 2.2% of the global population has ADHD. Different age and race groups
have differing amount of percentage of ADHD. In Georgia, I don't know how much people have ADHD,
but if we calculate 2.2% for the Georgian population (3.97 million people),
we get **87 thousand people in Georgia**.

ADHD is recognized as a disorder by The World Health Organization.
In [ICD-10](https://icd.who.int/browse10/2019/en#/) Disease Database ADHD is,
F90.0, F90.1, F90.2, F90.8, F90.9.

# How to treat ADHD?
ADHD is caused by a deficiency of specific neurotransmitters in the brain, norepinephrine and/or dopamine,
and is treated by using medication. Medicines that are not available in Georgia for an unknown reason.

There is a non-medicated methods, "therapy", but it is often combined with medication.
The main purpose of therapy is to deal with minor problems that medication cannot deal with.

Therapy without medication is not the primary treatment for ADHD. Because the effectiveness of this is often
questionable, it is a very long process, it takes months, while the medicine (stimulant) works in half an hour,
the long process also means many visits to the psychiatrist, which will be very expensive in total,
and this non-drug "therapy" cannot correct the imbalance of neurotransmitters by itself.

According to one article "The view that attention deficit can be overcome by willpower is as cynical
as advising a blind person to see by changing their lifestyle."

The equivalent of blindness for this "therapy" would be to help the blind person live with his other senses
(hearing, smell, touch, etc.), but the main problem would not be solved.
This will simply be an attempt to avoid the problem.

At the bottom of the page I have listed alternative ways to deal with ADHD 
that are less effective than medication. In other words, "they are better than absolutely nothing".

# What medication do we need for ADHD, what do and don't we have available in Georgia?
ADHD medication is split into 2 groups, stimulants and non-stimulants. In this table, I only added the most common medication.

### Stimulants: (NDRI, Norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor)
| Substance                                                                 | Brand names              |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| [Methylphenidate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylphenidate)          | Ritalin  <br>Concerta    |
| [Dexmethylphenidate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexmethylphenidate)    | Focalin                  |
| [Dextroamphetamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextroamphetamine)      | Dexedrine                |
| [Lisdexamfetamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisdexamfetamine)        | Vyvanse                  |
| [Mixed amphetamine salts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adderall)         | Adderall <br>Mydayis     |

### Non-stimulants: (NRI, Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor)
| Substance                                                 | Brand names           |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| [Atomoxetine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomoxetine)  | Strattera <br>Amatrix |
| [Viloxazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viloxazine)    | Qelbree               |



In Georgia, only **Atomoxetine** is registered, with "Amatrix" and "Strattera" brands.

Amatrix is a Turkish made medication and has not been made cheaper like other Turkish medication imported into Georgia,
This is why it approximately costs 200-250 GEL per month (on sale), 80 mg a day.
Amatrix supply is likely out of stock, I can't find it anywhere.
When there was some supply, I had to check few pharmacies to find anything.

Strattera is newly registered (in last 6 months) and I can't find it anywhere yet.

The problem with Atomoxetine and other non-stimulants are, it takes a few weeks for it to have any effect,
they have terrible side effects, and even if someone can cope with these side effects for few weeks, the result is going to be very small.
This is why, Atomoxetine is not a first-line treatment for ADHD. First line would be the stimulants.

Methylphenidate, Amphetamine, Dextroamphetamine are in a list of
[narcotic drugs](https://matsne.gov.ge/ka/document/view/1979040?publication=0).
While this is also the case in other countries, the difference is,
the doctors there can prescribe it when they think their patient needs it
and the patients can purchase them normally with their prescription.
In Georgia this is not the case.

Specifically Dexmethylphenidate and Lisdexamfetamine are not in that list,
so I don't know if any law applies to them specifically.

Abroad, in North America, in EU, in Turkey and in other developed countries, these medications are available by prescription.
In Georgia, you can not find these medication, doctors can not or will not prescribe it and you can't find it in any pharmacy.

For more information about ADHD medication, have a look at this
[Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_management#Medications).

Those who want to check which medications are registered in Georgia can have a look at this page:
[http://apps.ssa.gov.ge/recepti/Camlebi](http://apps.ssa.gov.ge/recepti/Camlebi)

# Why was this page created?
In USA, (and other developed countries) they have been taking ADHD seriously for the past 50 years.
Also, in USA, having ADHD is considered a disability.
In Georgia, nothing is happening in this regard, and it's entirely possible nothing will happen for decades to come,
if awareness for this problem is not raised.

This page was made out of necessity.
The goal of this page is to raise awareness about ADHD in the Georgian Healthcare System, because
in Georgia we definitely need the first line medication for ADHD and push for change.


# What are we asking for (in detail)
To prevent any misunderstandings, bellow I list everything we are asking for: (everything listed is important)

- Through doctor's prescription, availability of at least 1 ADHD stimulant medication
  - It must be able to be prescribed to all ages (children and adults)
  - It must be in stock at all times
  - It must be available for a reasonable price
  - It must be available in the dose and release duration combinations to be practically useful in all situations
    - This means, the availability of both short-acting and long-acting variants and in practically useful doses
  - Because ADHD practically requires daily medication, doctors should be free to prescribe it every month and indefinitely.
  - All conditions of this article must to be done right for every ADHD having citizen to effectively deal with ADHD.
- Through doctor's prescription, availability of at least 1 ADHD non-stimulant NRI (Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) type medication
  - It must be in stock at all times
  - It must be available for a reasonable price
  - It must be available in doses commonly prescribed by doctors.
- No time can be wasted throughout this process. The priority should be shifted to the request that can be performed in the shortest time. At the same time, some progress should be made on all requests.


# What can cause a push for change?
<!-- 
I think, this is in the competency of The **Ministry of Health**.

The contact information of The Ministry of Health can be found on their official web page:
[https://www.moh.gov.ge/ka/feedback/](https://www.moh.gov.ge/ka/feedback/)

For any progress to happen, it's important to let the Ministry hear out voices, and tell them that the current situation is bad.
Those who want to let the Ministry hear their voice can use the email or phone number on this page to contact them,
and **fill up a form** remotely.

It must be said, nothing will happen by itself,
especially if nothing has happened in the last few decades.
-->

Previously it was written here that this was within the competence of the **Ministry of Health** and
I encouraged our readers to write official statements, but recently I received a response from the Ministry of Health
to the official statement I wrote some time ago. Bellow is my translation, (original statement available on the Georgian version of this page):

<div class="alert border border-dark border-2" role="alert">
<p>Dear Giorgi,</p>

<p>In response to your statement regarding the availability of the drugs: Methylphenidate, Dexmethylphenidate and Dextroamphetamine in Georgia, we inform you that the drugs for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): Methylphenidate, Dexmethylphenidate, Dextroamphetamine and the pharmaceutical products containing them, as of today, are not registered in Georgia in the pharmaceutical market.</p>

<p>In "Law of Georgia on Medicines and Pharmaceutical Activities", according to Article 1¹, Clause 49, registration of a pharmaceutical product can be carried out by the manufacturer, trade license holder, importer or any other natural or legal person interested in placing the pharmaceutical product on the market. And the wholesale distributor has the right to import the pharmaceutical product (Clause 21 of Article 11 of the same law), who is authorized to carry out operations related to the purchase, storage, supply, export, import and re-export of pharmaceutical products, in compliance with the rules established by law. Therefore, Minister of IDPs from the occupied territories, labour, health and social affairs of Georgia is deprived of the opportunity to register and/or import pharmaceutical products.</p>

<p>In addition, we inform you that the legislation of Georgia provides for the possibility of importing medicinal products (including unregistered medicinal products in Georgia) for non-commercial purposes, for the individual needs of the patient, in accordance with the amounts determined by N01-31/N and N01-32/N Orders of June 15, 2011.</p>

</div>

My assumption was that, based on the official statements, the Ministry of Health would have the initiative
to negotiate with importers and wholesalers. I already knew that the Ministry of Health itself
does not import pharmaceuticals. It seems strange to me that a patient has to beg importers and wholesalers
for a pharmaceutical they require, but it seems that is exactly what we will have to do.

I am currently looking for the next course of action according this response. If you have any ideas,
contact me on the email provided at the bottom of this page.
If you know someone who is involved in pharmaceutical business, please show them our page.

Regarding the last paragraph, it does not work. You can bring in a maximum 31 days supply in your luggage with appropriate paperwork, 
which seems to be convenient only for people travelling into the country for a short time, but not for those who reside here.
You can't import it by ordering it, the stimulants seem to be exempt for some reason.

# Alternative solutions
Ever since I made this page, I have gotten several responses from our readers for alternative solutions to treat ADHD.
You'll find them bellow.

Different methods or combinations of methods may or may not work for different people.
Picking only one method may not bring much results without combining with another.

## Diet and Supplements
### Keto Diet and Carnivore Diet
Both Keto Diet and Carnivore Diet have lots of positive effect on physical and mental health.
I have gotten a response from a reader who has benefited from a Carnivore Diet and can freely read/work for 8 hours.
In his own words, "Thanks to this diet, I have 100 times better concentration than a healthy person."

### OMEGA-3.
OMEGA-3 can help 1/3 of ADHD havers, because they have a specific gene. The best results come after 3 months.

## Nootropics
**Please don't try these without consulting with your doctor first.**
Combination of the following 2 nootripics:

- Citicoline
- Piracetam

## Other medication (Not recommended)
Medication that was made for a different purpose but has some effect on ADHD.
These are worse then Atomoxetine. Not recommended due to side effects.
**Please don't try these without consulting with your doctor first.**

- Clonidine
- Duloxetine

# Frequently asked questions
### Can stimulants cause addiction?
Depends on what you mean by addiction. The word "addiction" is often misused. In order to answer this question, it is necessary to ask, "Does this medicine do its job?".

Let's make an example, let's say a doctor has given as an asthma diagnosis and prescribed a medication that makes living with asthma easier. Does this medicine do its job? Yes. Do we need it to do it's job? Yes. Does this technically make as addicted to this medication? Yes. What is the alternative? That you'd have to consult with your doctor.

The above answer implies the medication taken is in the doses prescribed by the doctor. This only becomes a problem, if the medication is taken in higher dose then prescribed systematically or without doctors prescription. Specifically to avoid bad dependence, stimulants only prescribed in lower doses for ADHD. One purpose of prescription is to control the dose. I can bring an argument that taking anything in high enough dose can lead to a bad result, regardless if it requires a prescription. This is why I see no problem with allowing doctors to prescribe stimulants. **We do not condone patients to take medication (especially stimulants) without a doctors prescription.**

# Theories
Nobody knows the exact reason ADHD exists, but here are some well known theories

### Hunters vs Farmers theory
For as long as humans existed, there were always those among them who had ADHD,
but this would not be considered a disorder, until the modern time,
this was just a feature. Like how one person has blonde hair, the other would have black hair.
Hundred thousand years ago, the society needed this sort of diversification,
we had "farmers" (with good attention), and we had "hunters" (ADHD havers).

Today, life is very different compared to how it was hundred thousand years ago. As time went on,
schools and professions were being invented while the proportion of ADHD havers were decreasing,
(probably with the "natural selection" method).

As stated at the top of the article, because today we all need to study, work long hours and advance our carriers,
ADHD is a real problem and makes our life difficult.

### Stressful environment theory
--  This will be added in future --
