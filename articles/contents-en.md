Due to demand, I have added an English page. All references to "Georgia" on this page refers to the country of Georgia.

# What is ADHD?

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder
characterised by excessive amounts of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that are pervasive,
impairing in multiple contexts, and otherwise age-inappropriate.

For as long as humans existed, there were always those among them who had ADHD,
but this would not be considered a disorder, until the modern time,
this was just a feature. Like how one person has blonde hair, the other would have black hair.
Hundred thousand years ago, the society needed this sort of diversification,
we had "farmers" (with good attention), and we had "hunters" (ADHD havers).

Today, life is very different compared to how it was hundred thousand years ago. As time went on,
schools and professions were being invented while the proportion of ADHD havers were decreasing,
(probably with the "natural selection" method, ADHD has many causes, one of them being - few different genes.)

Today, all of us are subjected to school form a young age, required to attend for hours every week day,
being required to pay attention at all times, doing homework, memorizing text (carefully reading)
and as an adult, 8-14 hours of work (that has to be done with attention),
and concurrently quick learning of new material for purpose of career advancement.
For reasons mentioned above, ADHD is considered a disorder in modern times and is a real problem.

ADHD is characterised by many symptoms, but, because ADHD has been most studied in children,
the name only focuses on attention deficit and hyperactivity,
as these are the most easily noticeable symptoms in children.
But the symptoms still last into adulthood and some are manifested differently from children.

The most noticeable and problematic symptom that is noticeable in all age group is **lack of attention control**.
In practice, this means, academic success is very difficult, one very specific example,
"[reading comprehension](https://naec.ge/uploads/postData/20-20/magistrebi/testebis%20nimushebi/%E1%83%AC%E1%83%90%E1%83%99%E1%83%98%E1%83%97%E1%83%AE%E1%83%A3%E1%83%9A%E1%83%98%E1%83%A1%20%E1%83%92%E1%83%90%E1%83%90%E1%83%96%E1%83%A0%E1%83%94%E1%83%91%E1%83%90.pdf)"
(one of the national exams),
is either difficult to do or impossible in the short time given, as this requires reading boring text while paying attention.

Approximately 2.2% of the global population has ADHD. Different age and race groups
have differing amount of percentage of ADHD. In Georgia, I don't know how much people have ADHD,
but if we calculate 2.2% for the Georgian population (3.97 million people),
we get **87 thousand people in Georgia**.

ADHD is recognized as a disorder by The World Health Organization.
In [ICD-10](https://icd.who.int/browse10/2019/en#/) Disease Database ADHD is,
F90.0, F90.1, F90.2, F90.8, F90.9.

# How to treat ADHD?
The simplest and the most effective treatment for ADHD is treatment by medication.
ADHD is caused by the lack of specific neurotransmitters, norepinephrine (and/or dopamine) in brain
and by treating this by daily medication is how you treat ADHD.

There are non-medication methods, "therapy", but if it helps,
(especially without combining it with medication), there would be no demand for medication.
This "therapy" cannot fix the the neurotransmitter disbalance.

According to one article "The view that attention deficit can be overcome by willpower is as cynical
as advising a blind person to see by changing their lifestyle."

The equivalent of blindness for this "therapy" would be to help the blind person live with his other senses
(hearing, smell, touch, thermoception, etc.), but the main problem would not be solved.
This will simply be an attempt to avoid the problem.

# What medication do we need for ADHD, what do and don't we have available in Georgia?
ADHD medication is split into 2 groups, stimulants and non-stimulants. In this table, I only added the most common medication.

### Stimulants: (NDRI, Norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor)
| Substance                                                                 | Brand names              |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| [Methylphenidate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylphenidate)          | Ritalin  <br>Concerta    |
| [Dexmethylphenidate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexmethylphenidate)    | Focalin                  |
| [Dextroamphetamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextroamphetamine)      | Dexedrine                |
| [Lisdexamfetamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisdexamfetamine)        | Vyvanse                  |
| [Mixed amphetamine salts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adderall)         | Adderall <br>Mydayis     |

### Non-stimulants: (NRI, Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor)
| Substance                                                 | Brand names           |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| [Atomoxetine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomoxetine)  | Strattera <br>Amatrix |
| [Viloxazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viloxazine)    | Qelbree               |



In Georgia, only **Atomoxetine** is registered, with "Amatrix" and "Strattera" brands.

Amatrix is a Turkish made medication and has not been made cheaper like other Turkish medication imported into Georgia,
This is why it approximately costs 200-250 GEL per month (on sale), 80 mg a day.
Amatrix supply is likely out of stock, I can't find it anywhere.
When there was some supply, I had to check few pharmacies to find anything.

Strattera is newly registered (in last 6 months) and I can't find it anywhere yet.

The problem with Atomoxetine and other non-stimulants are, it takes a few weeks for it to have any effect,
they have terrible side effects, and even if someone can cope with these side effects for few weeks, the result is going to be very small.
This is why, Atomoxetine is not a first-line treatment for ADHD. First line would be the stimulants.

Methylphenidate, Amphetamine, Dextroamphetamine are in a list of
[narcotic drugs](https://matsne.gov.ge/ka/document/view/1979040?publication=0).
While this is also the case in other countries, the difference is,
the doctors there can prescribe it when they think their patient needs it
and the patients can purchase them normally with their prescription.
In Georgia this is not the case.

Specifically Dexmethylphenidate and Lisdexamfetamine are not in that list,
so I don't know if any law applies to them specifically.

Abraod, in North America, in EU, in Turkey and in other developed countries, these medications are available by prescription.
In Georgia, you can not find these medication, doctors can not or will not prescribe it and you can't find it in any pharmacy.

For more information about ADHD medication, have a look at this
[Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_management#Medications).

Those who want to check which medications are registered in Georgia can have a look at this page:

# Why was this page created?
In USA, (and other developed countries) they have been taking ADHD seriously for the past 50 years.
Also, in USA, having ADHD is considered a disability.
In Georgia, nothing is happening in this regard, and it's entirely possible nothing will happen for decades to come,
if awareness for this problem is not raised.

This page was made out of necessity.
The goal of this page is to raise awareness about ADHD in the Georgian Healthcare System, because
in Georgia we definitely need the first line medication for ADHD and push for change.


# What are we asking for (in detail)
To prevent any misunderstandings, bellow I list everything we are asking for: (everything listed is important)

- Through doctor's prescription, availability of at least 1 ADHD stimulant medication
  - It must be able to be prescribed to all ages (children and adults)
  - It must be in stock at all times
  - It must be available for a reasonable price
  - It must be available in the dose and release duration combinations to be practically useful in all situations
    - This means, the availability of both short-acting and long-acting variants and in practically useful doses
  - Because ADHD practically requires daily medication, doctors should be free to prescribe it every month and indefinitely.
  - All conditions of this article must to be done right for every ADHD having citizen to effectively deal with ADHD.
- Through doctor's prescription, availability of at least 1 ADHD non-stimulant NRI (Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) type medication
  - It must be in stock at all times
  - It must be available for a reasonable price
  - It must be available in doses commonly prescribed by doctors.
- No time can be wasted throughout this process. The priority should be shifted to the request that can be performed in the shortest time. At the same time, some progress should be made on all requests.


# What can cause a push for change?
<!-- 
I think, this is in the competency of The **Ministry of Health**.

The contact information of The Ministry of Health can be found on their official web page:
[https://www.moh.gov.ge/ka/feedback/](https://www.moh.gov.ge/ka/feedback/)

For any progress to happen, it's important to let the Ministry hear out voices, and tell them that the current situation is bad.
Those who want to let the Ministry hear their voice can use the email or phone number on this page to contact them,
and **fill up a form** remotely.

It must be said, nothing will happen by itself,
especially if nothing has happened in the last few decades.
-->

In past this section said that this task is in the competency of The **Ministry of Health**, but recently I have gotten response from the Ministry of Health, bellow is a small translated excerpt:

<div class="card mb-4">
  <div class="card-body">
In "Law of Georgia on Medicines and Pharmaceutical Activities", according to Article 1¹, Clause 49, registration of a pharmaceutical product can be carried out by the manufacturer, trade license holder, importer or any other natural or legal person interested in placing the pharmaceutical product on the market. And the wholesale distributor has the right to import the pharmaceutical product (Clause 21 of Article 11 of the same law), who is authorized to carry out operations related to the purchase, storage, supply, export, import and re-export of pharmaceutical products, in compliance with the rules established by law. Therefore, Minister of IDPs from the occupied territories, labour, health and social affairs of Georgia is deprived of the opportunity to register and/or import pharmaceutical products.
  </div>
</div>

I am currently looking for the next course of action according this statement. If you have any ideas, contact me on the email provided at the bottom of this page. If you know someone who is involved in pharmaceutical business, please show them our page.

# Frequently asked questions
### Can stimulants cause addiction?
Depends on what you mean by addiction. The word "addiction" is often misused. In order to answer this question, it is necessary to ask, "Does this medicine do its job?".

Let's make an example, let's say a doctor has given as an asthma diagnosis and prescribed a medication that makes living with asthma easier. Does this medicine do its job? Yes. Do we need it to do it's job? Yes. Does this technically make as addicted to this medication? Yes. What is the alternative? That you'd have to consult with your doctor.

The above answer implies the medication taken is in the doses prescribed by the doctor. This only becomes a problem, if the medication is taken in higher dose then prescribed systematically or without doctors prescription. Specifically to avoid bad dependence, stimulants only prescribed in lower doses for ADHD. One purpose of prescription is to control the dose. I can bring an argument that taking anything in high enough dose can lead to a bad result, regardless if it requires a prescription. This is why I see no problem with allowing doctors to prescribe stimulants. **We do not condone patients to take medication (especially stimulants) without a doctors prescription.**
